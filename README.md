# Bus Company Managment System - Chatrooms & Maps

This is a final project that I did in high school which combined knowledge in several fields including communication and servers, Python language, frontend and creating an application, working with government databases, GPS interfaces, etc.

You are welcome to enter the PDF file named "Hebrew Readme" which is the complete guide to the entire project.

I made the project in 2019 so it may not work as well as it used to (due to different versions of plugins to be downloaded).
